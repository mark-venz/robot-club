* Robot Club
This is code to assist in learning:
 - how to code,
 - robotic concepts, and
 - source control

*NOTE* Branches are important, as not all functionality has been merged back into master.

** Robot
Arduino source for MakeBlock mBot/mCore:
 - http://www.makeblock.com/mbot-v1-1-stem-educational-robot-kit
 - http://www.makeblock.com/mcore-main-control-board-for-mbot

The code is enough to highlight some features of the robot.
Code derived from, and in some cases a subset of https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mBot

* TODO Instructions to follow
